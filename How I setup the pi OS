Enabled VNC on laptop so I can see the pi OS from my laptop, created a virtual enviornment on the pi and wrote a simple fastAPI which takes a test picture from the camera and saves it into my files. I had problems configuring the Pi, I initially tried to add 2 configuration files userconf.txt and ssh so it would enable SSH and join wifi automatically and I tried to run commands to connect to the Pi on powershell from my laptop I was running into issues like I was on a different network or the SSH comand failed and the VNC server wasn’t running by default so I had no access to the OS until I hooked all peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet) straight to the Pi then I gained access to the OS setup wifi and configured the Pi in the Pi OS terminal and was able to connect my laptop to VNC viewer from there.
